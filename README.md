# ECSD Tech Test
Welcome to the ECSD Tech Test 


## Running the application
You will need to have [node] and [yarn] both installed on your machine to run the app.

From the terminal run `yarn start`

## Challenge 
Once the app is started follow the instructions on the screen

## Limitations
There are no limitations set on this. If you are struggling to select elements you are free to edit the app source code where needed.
What we are looking for is a good understanding of what makes a robust test and a good understanding of engineering principles.

Note: you will not find the challenge answers in the application. Although you could hack the challenge or spam the API that verifies your answer you still need to submit your test for us to review. 

## Submit your test
Once completed push your submission into your forked repository. This will trigger one of our CI jobs to alert the appropriate people of your submission.
